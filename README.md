#DEXE

##Purpose
I made as an educational experience for myself.
It is a stack based bytecode interpreter.
There is no parser for this. I hand compiled all test files by hand.
DEXE stands for D EXEcutable. Not related to the D programming language. I started this project before I knew that the D language existed.

In case you're wondering, it's called v3 because it's the 3rd iteration.

##Examples

	./dexe ../test/test.dexe
	./dexe ../test/test2.dexe

##Compilation
On Windows:

	cd src
	compile
	
On Linux:

	cd src
	make
